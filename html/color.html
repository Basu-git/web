        A paragraph is a group of sentences focused on one main idea, acting as a building block in writing to structure thoughts logically for the reader, featuring a topic sentence to introduce the idea, supporting sentences for development and examples, and sometimes a concluding sentence to wrap it up, helping to create coherence and flow in essays or articles.
